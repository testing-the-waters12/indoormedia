                    <h2>Cost Effective Advertising</h2>
                    <p>Our coupons and advertisements are the most cost effective method of local advertising available. You can run a successful, vibrant marketing campaign with us for less than $6 per 1,000 impressions compared to flyers, direct mail, newspapers, or internet ads. Additionally, our ads are distributed to your customers an average of 7 times each month! Compare this to bulk mail which is delivered to the customer only once per month. </p>
                    <p>We print a minimum of 200,000 coupons every three months. These coupons are given to the shopper right at the distribution point. By comparison, mailings get thrown out with junk mail and newspaper ads get left on driveways. Radio and television ads depend on the right customers tuning in at the right times. This hit-and-miss approach does not yield a good return on your investment.</p>

                    <h2>What We Do Differently</h2>
                    <h4>Placed directly into the hands of the potential customer</h4>
                    <p>
                        We place your coupons right into the hands of the shopper right at the distribution point. The message doesn’t go into the mailboxes, onto the driveways or over the empty airwaves.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <p>
                        On average, shoppers visit the grocery store 1 to 2 times per week, and every time they are handed a receipt with your business name on it. Over a 13 week period, your potential customer sees your ad at least 26 times!  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Exposure</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our receipt tape coupons give you constant exposure. Unlike other forms of direct mail advertising that are limited in where they are distributed and when, your advertisement will be handed to each customer in the grocery store every day of the year.  
                    </p>
                    <h4>Hyperlocal Marketing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our program is extremely targeted and guaranteed to hit the advertiser’s potential customers that live, work, and buy groceries right in the local neighborhood. There is no other local advertising that is this precise! 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Grab Your Audience's Attention</h4>
                    <p>
                        Crafting an aggressive coupon offer is key to the success of your advertising campaign. Our Marketing Consultants are trained to help you create something eye-catching that will drive new customers to your business.

                        <h4>Implied endorsement</h4>
                        <p>Most shoppers believe that supermarkets give away coupons on store receipts for their personal benefit. This implied endorsement gives your business a boost. So, while there are other ways to advertise, none have the targeted local appeal of the grocery store.</p>

                        <p>Every business wants to make inroads with new residents. Studies have proven that one of the first things people do when relocating is to visit the supermarket. Within 72 hours of moving in, you will have already reached viable customers before they even have a chance to look up the competition.</p>

                        <h4>High distribution at low cost</h4>
                        <p>Local advertising can be expensive. A newspaper ad can cost as much as $15 to reach 1,000 people. Flyers and direct mail can be even worse. Cartvertising is much more affordable with much better visibility. For as little as $6 per thousand impressions, it is one of the most cost effective forms of local advertising around.</p>

                        <h4>Targeted HyperLocal Leads</h4>
                        <p>Most people buy groceries in their neighborhood. This means you can target the customers who live in the same neighborhood as your business. Because of this targeted marketing, every dollar you spend is directed at your most viable customers. No other local advertising can offer comparable service.</p>

                        <h4>Huge Exposure with Persistent Repetition</h4>
                        <p>The average grocery store has more than 20,000 customers per week. It is the hub of activity in any given community. Moreover, the average shopper visits the supermarket at least two times per week. This gives you the repetition and exposure needed for any successful advertising.</p>
