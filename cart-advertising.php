                    <h2>Establish Your Brand At Supermarkets</h2>
                    <p>Cartvertising is a unique marketing tactic that places your business advertisement on the seat frames of supermarket carts. These blank surfaces are usually only functional, but provide three separate places for advertising real estate, making the seat cover a prime spot for advertising.</p>
                    <p>Cartvertising capitalizes on this blank canvas, giving you the power to promote your local business at the supermarket closest to you. This is an excellent choice for any local business. Realtors, dentists, professional service providers, and more can all benefit from our cart advertising. In essence, the supermarket carts become a local business directory for shoppers in that neighborhood.</p>

                    <h2>What We Do Differently</h2>
                    <h4>Proven Track Record</h4>
                    <p>RTUI's grocery cart advertisements have been a staple of the advertising industry for almost 30 years. Our simple and easy to manage program has helped small businesses across the country become more profitable.</p>
                    <h4>Hyperlocal Marketing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our program is extremely targeted and guaranteed to hit the advertiser’s potential customers that live, work, and buy groceries right in the local neighborhood. There is no other local advertising that is this precise! 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Advertising Exposure for 43 Minutes Each Visit</h4>
                    <p>
                        Grocery shoppers keep their cart with them throughout their entire shopping experience. This means your advertisement is right in front of them for 43 minutes each time they visit the grocery store.  With RTUI your advertising message doesn’t go into the mailboxes, onto the driveways, or over the empty airwaves. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Target New Residents in the Area</h4>
                    <p>
                        Studies have shown that 86% of consumers will visit the grocery store within the first 72 hours of moving into a new area. With our targeted advertising program, our customer’s advertisement will reach the new residents before they’ve had an opportunity to go to their competitor. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <p>
                        On average, shoppers visit the grocery store between 1 and 2 times per week. Over a 13 week period, your potential customer sees your ad at least 26 times! No other type of hyperlocal advertising can promise this much repetition at such a reasonable cost per thousand.

                        <p>Since your ad will be seen for extended periods of time every week, Cartvertising is an excellent way to establish your brand. The more people see your business name and contact information, the more likely they are to remember your business when they need your services.</p>

                        <p>Local advertising can be expensive. A newspaper ad can cost as much as $15 to reach 1,000 people. Flyers and direct mail can be even more costly. Cartvertising is much more affordable with much better visibility. For as little as $6 per thousand impressions, it is one of the most cost effective forms of local advertising around.</p>

                        <h4>Implied endorsement</h4>
                        <p>Because shoppers are very loyal to their supermarket, each time they visit they will recognize your business' cart advertisements. Shoppers assume that these advertisements are specially selected and endorsed by the supermarket.This key advantage cannot be replicated with any other type of local marketing. </p>

                    <p>Cartvertising works because everyone holds onto their grocery cart throughout their entire shopping experience. During this time, your ad is literally right in front of them. It is impossible to overlook it. Better still, this happens more than once a week. Within several weeks, customers in your neighborhood will have seen your business name and contact information again and again and again.</p>
                    <p>Just think about other types of advertising. Newspaper ads require customers to turn pages. Radio spots rely on customers tuning in at just the right moment. Bulk mail is likely to end up in the trash within minutes.</p>
                    <p>There is no other local advertising that can compare to Cartvertising. If you want to make the most of your advertising dollars, Cartvertising is the option for you.</p>
