                    <h2>The Key to Restaurant Advertising</h2>
                    <p>
                        Operating a successful restaurant requires hard work and smart decision making. There is little margin for error in the food industry, which is why it is essential to make every marketing dollar count.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to build your restaurant, you need to establish brand awareness and bring more customers through your door. This starts with knowing your key customer base. Did you know that 85 percent of your consumers come from a five mile radius? Supermarkets share this same customer base because they serve as the hub of the community and attract customers unlike any other business.

                    <h2>The value of print advertising</h2>
                    <p>
                        In an increasingly digital world you may be reluctant to consider print advertising. However, print advertising is still a powerful tool for restaurants, and the reason is because of coupons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coupons still draw customers unlike any other marketing tactic. In fact, more than 90 percent of consumers use coupons. If you choose our advertising services, we will put coupons directly into the hands of your most viable customers.   
                    </p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Capitalize on supermarket advertising</h2>
                    <p>With our supermarket advertising, we can help you build a powerful marketing campaign that yields real results through the vitality of the supermarket. </p>
                    <p>The average grocery store has more than 20,000 customers per week who typically live less than 5 miles away. This is the same customer base your restaurant is already targeting, but now they will see your advertisements multiple times a week! Supermarkets are the ideal place to target your potential customers. </p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>How it works</h2>
                    <p>With our receipt tape advertising, your business ad is printed on the supermarket receipts in your neighborhood. We print a minimum of 200,000 coupons every three months, and every coupon is handed directly to the consumer.</p>
                    <p>This means that customers who live and work near your restaurant will be exposed to your ad two to three times a week. Additionally, the coupon is given to the person who makes the buying decisions for their household. </p>
                    <p>Only our service is able to reach these consumers with this amount of precision and repetition. On average, your most viable customers will receive your ad 7 times per month.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Cost effective solutions</h2>
                    <p>Local advertising can be very costly for a locally owned restaurant if you do not receive a return on your investment. A newspaper ad requires people to pick up their paper and open to the right page. Radio and television ads are entirely based on viewers tuning in at the right moment. Bulk mail is only delivered for a period of 20 days, often to a predetermined target market. </p>
                    <p>We place 200,000 coupons directly into the hands of your most likely customers every three months for $6 per 1,000 customer impressions.</p>

                        Taking advantage your existing receipt real estate can be a critical part of your ROI calculations. With our customer print solutions, you can turn a sunk cost into a vehicle for location based advertising. Whether marketing for a national, regional or local campaign, you can deliver your message in a medium that travels with your customer when they leave.  No other advertising medium provides this extended exposure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For larger businesses, receipt marketing is the perfect way to localize messaging while still carrying a unified brand. With custom print solutions, these businesses can target by neighborhood in a cost effective way. More than digital, radio, TV, or direct mail, a custom printed solution can be the foundation of your marketing campaign by providing a low cost, timely message that has a staying power far beyond its cost. Your receipts go out with every customer, every time.  Customers don’t need to open an envelop sent once every few weeks, they can’t turn it off, and it’s not hidden behind a ton of other content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smaller businesses rely on the customers in their neighborhood, referrals and word of mouth. A custom receipt provides a media that travels with the customer.  It provides instant exposure and can show up again and again. Your customers leave receipts on their desks, in their cars, and any number of other places.  This persistence helps drive conversations and decisions as it is a reminder of your location.
