                        <p>
                        Consumers do not pick their doctor or dentist like they pick other services. In fact, medical services are not just about convenience or cost. Consumers want to build a meaningful relationship with their doctor or dentist. They want a partnership that has the potential to last a lifetime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This can be good news for local doctors and dentists, but only if they know how to capitalize. If you want to turn your advertising dollars into actionable leads, try Cartvertising.

                        <p>
                            Cartvertising is a brilliant service that puts your customized ad onto the seat of a supermarket cart. It may sound simple, but the marketing strategy behind it is impossible to beat. The grocery store is the center of activity in any neighborhood. Since most people visit their local grocery store two or three times a week, your ad can be seen time and again, building your brand effortlessly.
                        </p>

                            INTRUSIVE, TARGETED SOLUTIONS
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Cartvertising is so effective because it requires no effort from consumers. Most other types of advertising require some consumer interaction. Newspaper ads have to be opened. Flyers have to be picked up. Radio ads need to be turned on. These ads can be effective, but only when consumers put in the effort at the right time. Cartvertising, on the other hand, is right there every time consumers visit the supermarket. If shoppers spend an hour in the store on a trip, that is an hour of constant advertising for your brand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Better still, this is a highly targeted marketing technique. Doctors and dentists rely heavily on a local consumer base. Cartvertising leverages the local power of the supermarket to appeal to people who live and work near your medical practice. Cartvertising is the best way to spend your advertising budget where it counts, appealing to consumers who are most likely to respond to your ad.

                                Cartvertising gives you more advertising power for a lower cost. Compared to other types of local media, Cartvertising is incredibly affordable at only $6 per 1,000 customer impressions. Even with the low cost, Cartvertising produces viable leads which give you a profitable return on your investment.

                            <p>
                                One of the best ways to build your medical or dental practice is to appeal to new residents. New residents need to find basic services as they transition into their new home. With Cartvertising, you can put your name out there for increased visibility. After all, most people visit the supermarket within three days of moving into a new home. That gives you time to reach new residents before your competition has a chance.
