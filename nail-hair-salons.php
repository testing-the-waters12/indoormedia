                    <h2>Appeal to Women</h2>
                    <p>Women dominate the retail marketplace. Although men's involvement in grocery shopping has increased in recent years, women continue to be the primary shoppers for their households. To create loyal female customers, start at the supermarket.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Local Community Hub</h2>
                    <p>On average, a grocery store will welcome 20,000 customers each week, and most of these visitors live in the same neighborhood as the supermarket. If you want to target the people who live and work near your salon, advertising with your local grocery store is the way to go.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Unparalleled Visibility</h2>
                    <p>The average grocery shopper visits the supermarket two to three times each week. By putting your hair or nail salon on receipts, your potential customers will literally be handed your business coupons every time they check out at the supermarket. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <h2>Cost effective solutions</h2>
                    <p>We know how expensive local advertising can be. A newspaper ad requires people to pick up their paper and open to the right page. Radio and television ads are entirely based on chance. Bulk mail is only delivered for a period of 20 days.</p>
                    <p>Compare that type of distribution with our service. We can place 200,000 coupons directly into the hands of your customers every three months for $6 per 1,000 customer impressions. </p>

                        <h4>Economical Choices</h4>
                        <p>Coupon advertising may seem like an expensive medium because it is traditional rather than the digital advertising we see today. However, print advertising is still a powerful tool for small hair and nail salons, and the reason is because of coupons. </p>
                        <p>Coupons still draw customers unlike any other marketing tactic. In fact, more than 90 percent of consumers use coupons. If you choose our advertising services, we will put coupons directly into the hands of your most viable customers who will in turn put money back into your local business. </p>

                        <h4>Targeted Marketing </h4>
                        <p>
                            Our receipt advertising is put directly into the customer's hand right at the distribution point. Because they are the one doing the shopping, they are most likely the decision maker for their household and the one most likely to use coupons.

                        <h4>Digital Integration</h4>
                        <p>
                           Our traditional print medium easily and effectively integrates with modern digital technology. By placing QR codes, website URLâ€™s, or barcodes on your coupons you can direct traffic to the digital media that will promote your business.

                    <h2>Your Advantage</h2>
                    <p>EXTENDED DISTRIBUTION: Newspaper, radio and television ads have limited runs, and mailers are only delivered a few times. You can print your ads on receipts for three months with our service.</p>
                    <p>ECONOMICAL CHOICES: For as much exposure as you get, our receipt advertising is still the most economical choice. You can reach 1,000 people with our ads for as little as $6.</p>
                    <p>TARGETED MARKETING: Our receipt advertising is put directly into the customer's hand. This person is probably the person with the buying power in his or her household, and there is a good chance they use coupons.</p>
                    <p>LOCAL IMPACT: People are extremely loyal to their local supermarket. By choosing to advertise at a supermarket near your salon, you will have instant access to the customers most likely to patronize your business.</p>
