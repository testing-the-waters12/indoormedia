                        <p>Realtors depend on a strong local market to be successful. A good realtor will build up his or her presence in a neighborhood, gaining credibility within that targeted area to spur on future growth and success. This strong personal branding can yield quality, actionable leads, which is why figuring out how to dominate the local market is critical.</p>
                        <p>Cartvertising is a powerful way to appeal to a targeted, local market. Cartvertising places customized ads on the seat of a supermarket cart. This seat is in front of shoppers throughout their entire trip, and most of the time, it is nothing but a blank canvas. In other words, it is a prime opportunity. By putting your ad there, your name and services will be front and center with this intrusive marketing style that is proven to work.</p>

                        <p>Cartvertising is an effective way to get your name out there because supermarkets are a hub of activity in any neighborhood. The vast majority of people shop within five miles of their home. This means that supermarkets are the best place to appeal to potential consumers in a given neighborhood. On top of that, most people visit the supermarket at least twice a week for an hour at a time. With Cartvertising, you will reach your desired local market for two hours every week. </p>

By taking advantage of supermarket Cartvertising you will be seen as a trustworthy and familiar advisor. For forty minutes each week you will greet your clients as your brand benefits from the implied endorsement from the grocery store. With repetition and exposure like this, you will be the clear choice for your clients.</p>

                            <p>Branding is about having a consistent presence with consumers. Cartvertising excels at this. Your ad will be seen during every supermarket visit, which ensures a consistent, repeat audience every week. Your brand will dominate in no time. </p>

                            Realtors are all about location. There is no better way to appeal to a specific neighborhood than Cartvertising. Since most shoppers visit their neighborhood store, you are sure to build your brand where it counts.

                                Local media can be expensive. If you want to take out a newspaper ad, you can expect to pay $15 to reach 1,000 people. The return on flyers is even less appealing. Cartvertising, by contrast, is the most affordable option, making it easy to fit into any advertising budget.

                            <p>
                                One of the hardest parts with any advertising campaign is making sure it reaches its intended audience. When you advertise in a newspaper, you have to trust consumers to open to the right page. Bulk mail has to avoid ending up in the recycle bin. A radio or television ad requires consumers to tune in at just the right moment. There is so much margin for error in these advertising mediums. Cartvertising, however, does not require consumers to pick up anything up or to tune in. Your Cartvertising ad is right there every time, ensuring unparalleled accessibility.
